# About
The goal of this project is to build a computer vision platform for understanding pose and form from workout videos.
The video tagging and analytics will aim to provide feedback on whether one is exercising correctly, and if not, recommend corrections to form and posture.

The project will be built in phases.

## Phase 1
- Build robust pose estimation algorithms by leveraging datasets and approaches described [here](https://paperswithcode.com/task/pose-estimation)
- Test various open source libraries

## Phase 2
- Build a framework that leverages pose estimation to annotate workout videos with a metric related to quality of workout
- These metrics have to be workout specific (squats vs bicep curl) and provide a clear explanation of how a user can improve their form for the specific exercise
